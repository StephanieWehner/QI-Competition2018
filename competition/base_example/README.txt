In this base example Alice and Bob will play the Mermin-Peres magic square game (more details in the competition instructions).

Alice and Bob will generate two shared entangled pairs.
Alice will received a random request of a row of the magic square and Bob a random request of a column.
Alice and Bob will then measure their qubits in three different ways using the functions 'measure_**' and outputs their measurement outcomes.

To run this example, first follow the competition instructions and make sure you have the backend of SimulaQron running.
Then to run the example, navigate to this folder using a terminal and type 'sh doNew.sh'.
If you run the example many times, does Alice and Bob win the game?
