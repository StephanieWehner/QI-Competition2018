This is the C library for accessing the CQC backend. The packet format is specified in cqc.h. Evidently, you will need a C compiler to compile and run these files, as well as a unix socket library (winsock is not supported). 

To build and test the library, proceed as follows:

- make   	- compile the library
- make tests 	- compile the gate tests
- make send	- compile a test client that will send a qubit
- make recv     - compile a test client that will ask to receive said qubit

After installation, you should first run "make", "make tests" and use testGates in order to verify the install. This will check the gates using tomography. This requires a small amount of time, so be patient :-)
