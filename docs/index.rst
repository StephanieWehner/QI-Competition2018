SimulaQron Documentation
========================

Welcome to the SimulaQron Beta Release! 

SimulaQron is a distributed simulation of the end nodes in a future quantum internet with the specific goal to explore application development. 
The end nodes in a quantum internet are few qubit processors, which may exchange qubits using
a quantum internet. 
Specifically, SimulaQron
allows the installation of a local simulation program on each computer in the network that provides the illusion of having a local quantum processor to potential applications.
The local simulation programs on each classical computer connect to each other classically, forming a simulated quantum internet allowing the exchange of simulated qubits between the different
network nodes, as well as the creation of simulated entanglement.

SimulaQron is written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and uses the `Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/>`_ Perspective Broker. To perform the local qubit simulation, SimulaQron uses `QuTip <http://qutip.org/>`_ but any other quantum simulator with a python interface can easily be used as a local backend. The main challenge of SimulaQron is to allow the simulation of virtual qubits at different network nodes: since these may be entangled they cannot be simulated on one network node, which is solved by a transparent distributed simulation on top of in principle any local simulation engine.

We also have a  `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08032>`_ that describe the design of SimulaQron.

The documentation below assumes familiarity with classical network programming concepts, Python, Twisted, as well as an elementary understanding of quantum information. More information on a competition at `Our website <http://www.simulaqron.org/>`_
