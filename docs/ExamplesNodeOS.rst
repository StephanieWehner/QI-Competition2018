Programming via the Classical-Quantum Combiner Interface 
========================================================

SimulaQron can be access from any programming language supporting network connections. Instructions to the quantum hardware simulation can be sent via the CQC interface described below. 

A C and Python Library for programming SimulaQron using the CQC Interface are provided. If you are new to SimulaQron, programming via the Python CQC is the easiest way to get started.
